You need to download Unity3D Community (Personal):

And you also need an editor for the code.
I recommend for macOS and Linux:
https://www.monodevelop.com/download/

And for Windows:
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/unity-tools/
during installing you will be asked to install build tools.
install:
`Linux Build Support`

If you're on a Windows computer also install:
`Windows Build Support`

If you're on a Mac also install:
`Mac Build Support`
